The following notes were generated across my local OS X install, ubuntu running on travis-ci and win builder. Response to NOTEs across three platforms below.

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE

  Roxygen2 is not a spelling error.

* checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE
  Namespaces in Imports field not imported from:
  'Lahman' 'hflights' 'magrittr' 'methods'
  
  I'm resonably certain this is a spurious warning. Lahman and hflights
  are data packages and hence have nothing to import. Functions from
  magrittr and methods are used with :: (but during package build 
  so I don't think the current checks see them)
