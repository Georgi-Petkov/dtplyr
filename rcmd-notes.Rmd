The following notes were generated across my local OS X install, ubuntu running on travis-ci and win builder. Response to NOTEs across three platforms below.

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE

  Roxygen2 and dplyr are not spelling errors.

* checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... NOTE

  This is a spurious note; dplyr depends on R >= 3.0.2

I couldn't replicate the problems with microbenchmark reported by BDR on any of the three platforms I test on. If this is a concern I can disable the vignette that uses microbenchmark and remove it from the suggests.
