The following notes were generated across my local OS X install, ubuntu running on travis-ci and win builder.

* checking package dependencies ... NOTE

  These are both because dplyr suggests bigrquery, which is 
  currently not on CRAN.

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE

  As expected, this is a new package.

* checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... NOTE
  
  This is a spurious note; dplyr depends on R >= 3.0.2

* checking installed package size ... NOTE

  I don't think there's anything I can do about the size of the libs 
  directory.
