* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE

  As expected, this is a new package.

* checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... NOTE
  
  This is a spurious note; dplyr depends on R >= 3.0.2

* checking installed package size ... NOTE

  I don't think there's anything I can do about the size of the libs 
  directory.

* checking Rd line widths ... NOTE

  This is a long URL. I don't know of a way to shorten it in Rd.
  I could use a url shortener, but then that makes it less clear where
  you are going.
