# Introduction

This vignette shows the details of how dtplyr translates dplyr expressions into [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki) code. If you see places where you think I could generate better data.table code, please let me know!

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(dtplyr)
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
```

# The basics

To get started, I'll create a simple lazy frame. The actual data doesn't matter here since we're just looking at the translation:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(a = integer(), b = integer(), c = integer(), d = integer())
dt <- lazy_dt(df)
```

When we print it out, it tells us that it's a local data table with four rows. It also prints the call that dtplyr will evaluate when we execute the lazy table. In this case it's very simple: 

```{r}
dt
```

If we just want to see the generated code, you can use `show_query()`. I'll use that a lot in this vignette.

```{r}
dt %>% show_query()
```


# Simple verbs

Many dplyr verbs have a straightforward translation to either the `i` or `j` component of `[.data.table`. 


## `i`

`filter()` and `arrange()` become elements of `i`:

```{r}
dt %>% arrange(a, b, c) %>% show_query()
dt %>% filter(b == c) %>% show_query()
dt %>% filter(b == c, c == d) %>% show_query()
```

## `j`

`select()`, `rename()`, `summarise()` and `transmute()` all become elements of `j`:

```{r}
dt %>% select(a:b) %>% show_query()
dt %>% rename(x = a, y = b) %>% show_query()
dt %>% summarise(a = mean(a)) %>% show_query()
dt %>% transmute(a2 = a * 2) %>% show_query()
```

`mutate()` also uses the `j` component with data.table's special `:=` operator:

```{r}
dt %>% mutate(a2 = a * 2, b2 = b * 2) %>% show_query()
```

Note that dplyr never modifies the input data, so here it automatically `copy()`s the input data.table.

`mutate()` allows to refer to variables that you just created. data.tables `:=` doesn't support that out of the box, so we automatically chain together as many `[` as needed:

```{r}
dt %>% mutate(a2 = a * 2, b2 = b * 2, a4 = a2 * 2) %>% show_query()
```

`transmute()` works similarly:

```{r}
dt %>% transmute(a2 = a * 2, b2 = b * 2, a4 = a2 * 2) %>% show_query()
```

## Grouping

Just like in dplyr, `group_by()` doesn't do anything by itself, but instead modifies the operation of downstream verbs. This generally just involves using the `by` argument:

```{r}
dt %>% group_by(a) %>% summarise(b = mean(b)) %>% show_query()
```

The primary exception is grouped `filter()`, which requires the use of `.SD` ()

```{r}
dt %>% group_by(a) %>% filter(b < mean(b)) %>% show_query()
```

# Combinations

dtplyr tries to generate generate data.table code as close to what you'd write by hand as possible, as this tends to unlock data.tables tremendous speed. For example, if you `filter()` and then `select()`, dtplyr generates a single `[`:

```{r}
dt %>% filter(a == 1) %>% select(-a) %>% show_query()
```

And similarly for filtering and summarising:

```{r}
dt %>% 
  group_by(a) %>% 
  filter(b < mean(b)) %>% 
  summarise(c = max(c)) %>% 
  show_query()
```

Note however, that `select()`ing and then `filter()`ing must generate two separate calls to `[`, because data.table evaluates `i` before `j`.

```{r}
dt %>% select(-a) %>% filter(a == 1) %>% show_query()

```

Note that `filter()` and `mutate()` can't be combined because `dt[a == 1, .(b2 := b * 2)]` modifies the selected rows in place.

Over time, as I learn more about data.table, I hope to expand the set of these simplifications.
